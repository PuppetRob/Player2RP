FREECITY DEVELOPMENT

Thanks for purchasing freecity_paintball!

Please take a look at the file shared.lua and take the following steps in order to get this script up and running

1 - Decide if you want to use a targeting system or a blip system using the vars:
    - Config.spawnMarker
    - Config.useTargetSystem

2 - Choose if you want to spawn a ped at the startLocation (if using targeting system it's mandatory)

3 - Configure the clothes that the players will get when spawning

4 - Ensure the weapon resource in your resources (folder PaintBall)

5 [ESX] - Run the SQL file to create the WEAPON_PAINTGUN in your SQL Database

5 [QBCORE] - Add the WEAPON_PAINTGUN to your weapon/item files

6 - To create new maps/zones to fight just copy one of the maps created and follow the lines adding the blue team spawn, the red team spawn, and the center of the map (more or less)

7 - To add the image of the map,  just add the image to the folder /img with the same name as the key of the map. (/img/miningyard.jpg) (add jpg files only)

We hope that you have a good time playing this mod!
